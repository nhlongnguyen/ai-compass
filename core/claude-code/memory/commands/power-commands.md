## Universal Behavioral Flags

### Thinking Modes
Apply to any request for enhanced analysis depth:

**Natural Language Activation:**
- "think about this" - Multi-component analysis (standard)
- "think hard about this" - Complex system analysis (architecture-level) 
- "think deeply about this" - Critical/complete redesign (comprehensive)

### MCP Tool Preferences
Control external tool integration through natural language:

**Natural Language Activation:**
- "look up documentation" - Context7 documentation lookup
- "analyze step by step" - Sequential step-by-step analysis
- "generate UI component" - Magic UI component generation
- "test in browser" - Puppeteer browser testing

### Execution Modes
Control planning and output through natural language:

**Natural Language Activation:**
- "show me the plan first" - Show execution plan before implementation
- "work interactively" - Step-by-step guidance with user input
- "keep it compressed" - 70% token reduction output
- "explain everything" - Detailed explanations and reasoning

## Behavioral Integration Patterns

### Persona Auto-Activation
Natural language requests automatically activate appropriate cognitive modes:

```yaml
Analysis_Requests:
  "analyze security" → security persona
  "analyze performance" → performance persona
  "analyze architecture" → architect persona
  "analyze code quality" → refactorer persona

Development_Requests:
  "build React component" → frontend persona
  "build API" → backend persona
  "build system" → architect persona

Problem_Solving_Requests:
  "troubleshoot issue" → analyzer persona
  "debug systematically" → analyzer persona
  "find root cause" → analyzer persona

Learning_Requests:
  "explain this concept" → mentor persona
  "teach me about" → mentor persona
  "help me understand" → mentor persona
```

### Confidence-Driven Adaptation

```yaml
High_Confidence_Requests:
  - Direct execution with clear communication
  - Proactive quality gates
  - Comprehensive analysis

Medium_Confidence_Requests:
  - Present approach for validation
  - Seek clarification on uncertainties
  - Provide alternative options

Low_Confidence_Requests:
  - Collaborative approach required
  - Research-first protocol activation
  - Human guidance integration
```

### Context-Aware Behavior

```yaml
File_Context_Triggers:
  "*.tsx, *.jsx files" → Frontend development patterns
  "*.test.* files" → QA testing patterns
  "*refactor* files" → Code improvement patterns
  "*.sql files" → Backend database patterns

Project_Context_Triggers:
  "React project" → Frontend-optimized behaviors
  "API project" → Backend-optimized behaviors
  "Full-stack project" → Integrated development patterns
```

## Task Management Integration

### Automatic Task Creation
Complex requests trigger systematic task management:

```yaml
Complexity_Thresholds:
  - ≥8 complexity points → Auto-create task list
  - 5-7 points → Brief notification of approach
  - <5 points → Normal execution

Task_Execution_Patterns:
  - One task in_progress at a time
  - Update status immediately after completion
  - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
  - Remove irrelevant tasks entirely
```

### Quality Gates Integration

```yaml
Built_In_Quality_Gates:
  - Code reviews for significant changes
  - Testing before deployment recommendations
  - Performance validation for optimizations
  - Security scanning for sensitive operations
  - Evidence requirements for optimization claims
```
