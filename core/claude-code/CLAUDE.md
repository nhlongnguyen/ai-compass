# AI Compass - Claude Code Configuration

*AI Compass v1.0.0 | Modular memory architecture for Claude Code*

## Memory Architecture
This configuration uses Claude Code's native import system to create a modular, maintainable memory structure. Each component focuses on a specific aspect of AI collaboration.

## Core Framework
@./memory/core/philosophy.md
@./memory/core/confidence-system.md
@./memory/core/token-economy.md
@./memory/core/context-management.md

## Specialized Systems
@./memory/personas/personas-integration.md
@./memory/rules/engineering-standards.md
@./memory/rules/quality-gates.md
@./memory/mcp/tool-orchestration.md
@./memory/commands/power-commands.md

## Quick Reference

### Confidence Levels
- **â‰¥90%**: Independent execution with validation
- **70-89%**: Collaborative validation required
- **<70%**: Human partnership required

### Key Commands
- `/user:analyze --code` - Code analysis
- `/user:build --react --magic` - AI-assisted development
- `/persona:architect` - Switch to systems thinking
- `/user:explain --uc` - Ultra-compressed explanations

### Memory Management
- Use `#` for quick memory additions
- Use `/memory` for comprehensive memory editing
- Use `/init` to bootstrap project-specific memories
