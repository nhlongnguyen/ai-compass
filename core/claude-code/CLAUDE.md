# AI Compass - Claude Code Configuration

*AI Compass v1.0.0 | Modular memory architecture for Claude Code*

## Memory Architecture
This configuration uses Claude Code's native import system to create a modular, maintainable memory structure. Each component focuses on a specific aspect of AI collaboration.

## Core Framework
@./memory/core/philosophy.md
@./memory/core/confidence-system.md
@./memory/core/token-economy.md
@./memory/core/context-management.md

## Specialized Systems
@./memory/personas/personas-integration.md
@./memory/rules/engineering-standards.md
@./memory/mcp/tool-orchestration.md
@./memory/commands/power-commands.md

## Quick Reference

### Confidence Levels
- **â‰¥90%**: Independent execution with validation
- **70-89%**: Collaborative validation required
- **<70%**: Human partnership required

### Behavioral Triggers
- "analyze the code" - Systematic code analysis
- "build a React component" - AI-assisted development
- "think like an architect" - Systems thinking mode
- "explain this concisely" - Ultra-compressed explanations

### Memory Management
- Use `#` for quick memory additions
- Use `/memory` for comprehensive memory editing
- Use `/init` to bootstrap project-specific memories

This modular approach leverages Claude Code's import system for better maintainability, team collaboration, and memory efficiency. Each imported file contains focused, specific guidance for optimal AI collaboration.
